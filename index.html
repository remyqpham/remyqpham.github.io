						<h1>It Gets Better Everyday</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li>woke up, grabbed a quick breakfast in Nice before heading to the train station to head to cannes</li>
							<li>headed to the gare de nice, only to find out we were supposed to go to nice st augustin station.  what started off as a calm morning turned slightly hectic as we raced to make the right train</li>
							<li>we arrived on time, and met our second airbnb host, catherine, who was gracious enough to pick us up from the station.</li>
							<li>she brought us into her lovely home, about 2km inland from the coast of cannes.  we rested for a moment, and she took us on a short, scenic drive and dropped us off near the port.</li>
							<li>we walked around in awe of the abundance of shops, cafes and people.  I ate at a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant, and ordered a kebab wrap with SAMURAI SAUCE BAYBAY!!! it's quickly becoming my favorite quick meal/sawce</li>
							<li>we met a local canadian couple at that restaurant, one of which happened to work at cisco, like me! small world indeed.  I am just now realizing how dumb I must have sounded, asking him simply "oh you work for cisco too?  Do you know sean?  You know, sean."  derp</li>
							<li>foolishness aside, they ended up giving us some great tips for traveling in cannes, and recommended going to the ile ste marguerite, the bigger of a pair of islands just off the coast of cannes.  they mentioned it costs only 12 euros to get there, and that you might as well be in the caribbean when you arrive.  I guess I know what we're doing tomorrow afternoon.</li>
							<li>they also told us about an ongoing weekly international fireworks competition hosted in cannes, with britain showing off their stuff tomorrow night.  anyone on the coast of cannes near the port will have a front row seat.  I guess I know what we're doing tomorrow evening.</li>
							<li>my friend, thibaud, who i met during my last visit to cannes, also made plans with us tomorrow night to some big club dance thing with world famous dj's.  he promised us a good time.  so I guess I know what we're doing tomorrow night.</li>
							<li>I think this trip has made me insensitized to amazing things.  I mean seriously, read those last three bullet points.  holy shit! this is amazing!!</li>
							<li>we continued walking around, and found an Orange.fr retailer, where, after an hour's worth of fussing and practicing my french, I finally got working internet, international sms, mms, and calling on my phone! the workers were very friendly and super helpful</li>
							<li>jenny had almost died of starvation at this point, so we hurried to another cafe where she had a salmon quiche and I had my seventh cup of coffee, my 65th of our trip so far.</li>
							<li>we then made our way back to Catherine's home, not before strolling through the shops a bit more, people watching, and picking up some groceries for dinner. I got simply a baguette, paté, brie cheese, and some fruit.  who am I?</li>

							<li>had an interesting encounter with some french punks on the bus.  they first tried to get onto the bus without paying, and were promptly caught.  one of them then shoved me aside to stand next to his friend, which I let go because hey, sometimes people are rude and it's better not to start anything.  then, that same young gentleman moved to a seat behind jenny's and actually pulled out ten of her hairs.  I didn't notice as I was facing the other way, but when she told me, I immediately turned around and gave him my menacing and tear-inducing mean face for a good ten seconds.  In an accent thicker than my wool socks, he asked "is there a problem?"  I replied "encore?" (again?), and he proceeded to look a bit surprised that I spoke french.  all the french my mom taught me kicked in, and I instinctually told him to "dégage", which I think means something along the lines of "piss off."  He got off at the next stop. Kids these days, amirite?  thanks mom</li>

							<li>we made it back to Catherine's, and decided to stay in for the night to take in the past few days, enjoy dinner in her beautiful home, and blog.  Catherine is easy to talk to, and a great host already.</li>
