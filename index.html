						<h1>How to Feel Poorer</h1>
						<p>Visit Monte Carlo.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>went to the market, bought a banana.</li>
							<li>ate breakfast/lunch at a small cafe at the Port de Nice</li>
							<li>had a croque monsieur because I love those</li>
							<li>got on the 100 bus to monaco/monte carlo, not without feeling like barfing on the way off the bus</li>
							<li>visited the monte carlo casino (da REAL one), and roamed around the area in search of good pictures, views, and food</li>
							<li>found all three!</li>
							<li> after a long day of walking in our xero shoes, or should I say chafing my feet, we returned to nice to dive into the waters of the ocean</li>
							<li>IT IS TOO HOT HERE</li>
							<li>Rough estimate from C to F is *2+30.  Thanks to grandpa for the tip</li>

						<h1>The Kindness of Old Friends</h1>
												<ul>
							<li>met up with Lisanne's mom, who graciously picked us up from the airport at 5pm</li>
							<li>She took us to Lisanne's vacated apartment, where we would stay for the next three nights</li>
							<li>we were starving at this point, so we left immediately to go to old nice, where we took in the beautiful sights and architecture and enjoyed some delicious seafood</li>
							<li>eating in europe in general is so different than in the states (am I becoming that pretentious kid who studied abroad and will only refer to the USA as the states already? *puffs cigarette and sips espresso*), and not just food-wise.  There is absolutely no rush at all to finish your meal.  I feel that back home, whenever I eat out (which was too often), the bill would be handed to you promptly and usually without asking.  In my dining experiences abroad, if you don't ask for the bill, you won't get it.  And it really made for a special experience.  My dinner with Jenny and Liesbeth went on for two and a half hours, and it absolutely flew by.  Though I'm not used to such long meals, there was no pressure to continue conversation.  I love the pace here.</li>
							<li>Driving, however, scares the shit out of me here</li>
							<li>Liesbeth took us on a quick tour by car after dinner on the way back to the apartment, showing us various bars and hotels to visit.  She told me that sometimes, when she can't find parking, she'll pretend to stay at a hotel just so the valet will take her car.  A life pro tip I will definitely try out one day.</li>
