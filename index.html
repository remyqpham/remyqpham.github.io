						<h1>I am Remy; Kebab Man</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li>It was tough leaving Cannes, but I'm sure I will be back one day.  Catherine graciously took us back to the train station, where we caught our TGV to Aix en Provence, followed by a quick transfer to Marseille.  The delay on our first train forced us to get reimbursed for our second train, which we subsequently missed; at least it made for another interactive experience with a worker there!</li>
							<li>we were starving by the time we got off the trains, as the onboard food services, however convenient, were mightily expensive.  our time with our grumbling stomachs paid off as I hastily made my way to the nearest kebab restaurant, where I'd scarf down a kebab wrap with fries and a coca.  yum.</li>
							<li>we arrived at Sophie's apartment, our third AirBnB host, quickly, as she only lives ten minutes away from the station.</li>
							<li>she greeted us with a warm smile as we ascended forty flights of stairs to get to her floor of the building (alright it was four, but still, with heavy packs, I'll round up).  </li>
							<li>I think there is for some reason or another a trend of french living spaces looking almost shitty from the outside, but absolutely gorgeous on the inside.  Her apartment is beautiful, spacious, and decorated simply yet fancily.  I got the same impression from Catherine's home and Liesbeth's apartments as well.  It, for me, is really symbolic of the whole 'what matters is on the inside' thing.  I love it.</li>
							<li>Sophie lives conveniently close to the port of marseille and a million cafes, restaurants and shops.  it made traveling by foot an endlessly entertaining experience.  we first walked to the port and discovered a beautiful view in the port of marseille with many boats and onlookers alike.</li>
							<li>we made our way down the west side of the port, and stopped at a cafe for a quick noisette.</li>
							<li>we made our way south to the MuCEM, a museum on the coast.  there we found beautiful views and architecture.  I'll let the pictures I'll upload later do the talking.</li>
							<li>we mostly walked for the rest of the night, and stopped to eat at a mediterranean restaurant.  we yelped it and chose it for its cheap price, but were pleasantly surprised with how big the portions were and how tasty they were. </li>
							</ul>

						<h1>I am Ruler of Kebabs</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li> i #$^*ing love kebabs.  kebabs for breakfast lunch dinner dessert. avec frites bien sur. I dream of these things.</li>
							<li>we've relied less on yelping and google mapping and more on our own eyes, ears, and mouths, as we've traversed the land and searched for places to fill our food holes.  we found a nice cafe this morning and had breakfast. I had a croque monsier and jenny had an omelette, a solution to her hankering 4 sum eggz.</li>
							<li>after, we made our way to the Notre Dame de la Garde, which promised us beautiful views and the urge to throw up after climbing the hill up.  alright it wasn't that bad but still.</li>
							<li>That promise was completely fulfilled as we finally reached the top, as I was given what I think, at this point, is the best view I've seen in Europe.  again, i'll let my pictures do most of the blogging.</li>
							<li>we descended down the hill after checking out the overwhelmingly beautiful interior of said church, and walked to the palais de pharo park, which was a great place to relax and take in the sights, as well as our day.</li>
							<li>I grabbed a kebab before we went back to Sophie's apartment to shower and relax. remembering that a bar along the port had happy hour until 22h, or 10pm.(I'm really getting used to military time here), we decided to head out again.</li>
							
							<li>we quickly got dressed and headed out, but not before having a quick drink with sophie, who again, has been a lovely host along with her boyfriend.</li>
							<li>we got to the bar and ended up having, in total, four beers, six cocktails, and one great conversation with jen.  we proceeded to head back after a few hours out and promptly PTFO.</li>
							</ul>

						<h1>I am Kebab</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li>jenny had a pretty rough time getting up this morning, again, for reasons I cannot deduce.</li>
							<li>we wanted to make our way to les calanques, a completely scenic mountain side south of marseille, but due to fire hazards it was closed after 11h.  not much different from some parts of the states as I read online.  scary stuff.</li>
							<li>we instead went out and grabbed some food (guess what I got), and just relaxed for the day.  funnily enough, I had a brain fart and thought we'd only stay in marseille for two days.  this third extra day warranted time to relax, naturally.</li>
							<li>we napped and ended the day on a nice walk to a small public beach called Les Catalanes, which was completely overpacked and prevented swimming for us.  we ate at le palais de pharo again, which was really nice.</li>
							<li>we came back tonight pretty early to prepare for nimes, and ended up having a great conversaion with sophie et son mari.  airbnb, for all intensive purposes, is truly better than a hotel stay.  there are so many upsides that aren't accounted for, and for which I'm truly appreciative.</li>
							<li>onto nimes!</li>
