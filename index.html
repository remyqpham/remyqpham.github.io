						<h1>The Best Way to Plan a France Trip...</h1>
						<p>...is with no plans at all </p>

						<ul>
							<li>schedule for the day: find a way to deliver our luggage to carcassonne, our sixth and second to last stop on our trip.  and that's it.  we let the rest of the day sort itself out.</li>
							<li>an unnecessarily complicated search for luggage delivery services via Fedex lead to a fascinating drive inland, as well as interesting conversations with our Uber driver, who happens to be from Nimes, our 5th stop along the coast.</li>
							<li>went to the beach again</li>
							<li>freshened up and hopped on a random bus</li>
							<li>witnessed an entertaining encounter between the bus driver and a lady, consisting of screaming back and forth on the bus.  from what I could gather, she was complaining about his driving and her being late to work, and he repeatedly told her he could do nothing about it. we got off at the next stop</li>
							<li>realizing there was nothing around us, we hopped on another bus and got off, again randomly, at a stop a few minutes further down, and ended up at Rue de Massene.</li>
							<li> it was TOTALLY POPPIN and ended up being an amazing surprise, and a wonderful way to end our excursion in nice</li>
							<li>had a kebab wrap, which brought back memories of my first taste back in high school, and it was absolutely phenomenal.  ever had samurai sauce? it's insane.</li>
							<li>walked around after and took a look at a few shops. </li>
							<li>ate at Pinocchio, an italian cafe/restaurant, attended by a waitress that seemed to understand no language at all</li>
							<li>had my first crepe this time around in france, which was okay, and some pizza and beers as well.</li>
							<li>ended up walking back to the apartment down the Promenade des Anglais, a famous beachside street that gave us enough Cote d'Azur to take in for a lifetime.</li>
							<li>/sleep</li>
							
						</ul>

						<p>Jenny and I woke up as usual with grumbling stomachs, which usually makes for conversations usually quick, short, sharp, and mean, filled with 'hangry' remarks at each other until our insatiable appetites are filled. The cafe next door for breakfast? Ça suffit.</p>

						<h1>How to Feel Poorer</h1>
						<p>Visit Monte Carlo. (pronounced MONEY CAR-HOEZ)</p>
						<h2>Notes</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>went to the market, bought a banana.</li>
							<li>ate breakfast/lunch at a small cafe at the Port de Nice</li>
							<li>had a croque monsieur because I love those</li>
							<li>got on the 100 bus to monaco/monte carlo, not without feeling like barfing on the way off the bus</li>
							<li>visited the monte carlo casino (da REAL one), and roamed around the area in search of good pictures, views, and food</li>
							<li>found all three!</li>
							<li> after a long day of walking in our xero shoes, or should I say chafing my feet, we returned to nice to dive into the waters of the ocean</li>
							<li>IT IS TOO HOT HERE</li>
							<li>Rough estimate from C to F is *2+30.  Thanks to grandpa for the tip</li>


						</ul>

						<p>As with the general approach to this trip, we planned almost nothing aside from the cities to visit.  We have been influenced by passive Google searches, advertisements and memories of what-to-do's from friends and family, but the origin of most of our activities actually stems from conversations with strangers.  I like it better this way; to have the input of locals, good or bad, makes me feel more included in this daunting new environment.  I also get the opportunity to practice my French again...I still got it. :3</p>
						<p>We strolled out of the apartment and into Boulevard de Carlone, our eyes hungrily searching for anything edible.  Just before I considered eating my t-shirt sleeve (which was already drenched in sweat à cause de le stupidly hot weather in Nice), I spotted a banana in a market next door.  I took it, bought it, and ate it.  So much for a first authentic breakfast in France.</p>
						<p>Dimly satisfied, we went on to a bus stop a few blocks down the road and hopped on a bus to Le Port, Nice.  The Port of Nice and all of its beauty was almost enough to deter my steady hunger...almost.  We stopped for a few pictures, and went on our way in search of another place (un)fortunate enough to attempt to fill our voracious appetites.</p> 
						<p>We found a small café, in which I had my first experience with a French local who spoke no English at all.  Seeing as how English is quite ubiquitous a language, it seemed silly how surprised I was at first to be limited only to French.  Brief anxiety set in, realizing my sole means of communication at this point was still covered in rust, but it didn't last long; she smiled and proceeded to talk to me in a more elementary way, which was by no means condescending, but rather helpful, and my order of a Croque Monsieur was received, delivered, and enjoyed.  Being one of my favorite French dishes, I was set even more at ease as the day wore on.</p>
						<p>After lunch, we headed back to the Port to catch the 100 bus to Monaco.  On the scenic yet barf-inducing 45-minute coastal ride, we met a Norwegian couple heading in the same direction.  They reminded me of Monte Carlo, their destination, where I found myself three years ago in my senior year of high school on a spring break trip.  We decided to go there.</p>

						<p>Monte Carlo is where your dreams of riches go to elicit your wildest feelings of jealousy, taunt you to take pictures of things you'll always want and never have, and subsequently die.  But it was still pretty cool.</p>
						<p>There were sports cars everywhere, with the best of the best parked lavishly in front of the casino.  The architecture was one of the only things that looked richer than the people.</p>

						<p>Then, we went on our random ways and strolled about the small country, ending at a high point on which you could see Monte Carlo in all of its glory.  The ensemble of buildings, cars, people, and color made for a riveting experience.  I'll never forget it here.</p>
						<p>We stopped by another small cafe in Monte Carlo just before heading back to Nice.  I find myself getting a small café everytime I eat.  *gasp* I'm just like my mother. </p>
						<p>For the sake of ease and time, we took the train back from Monaco station.  Just before bed, we decided to hop in the ocean waters of Nice for the first time.  I can't begin to tell you how refreshing it was; a brief escape from the nearly unbearable heat (for this spoiled Californian) felt amazing.  </p>
						<p>On to day 3.</p>

						<h1>The Kindness of Old Friends</h1>
												<ul>
							<li>met up with Lisanne's mom, who graciously picked us up from the airport at 5pm</li>
							<li>She took us to Lisanne's vacated apartment, where we would stay for the next three nights</li>
							<li>we were starving at this point, so we left immediately to go to old nice, where we took in the beautiful sights and architecture and enjoyed some delicious seafood</li>
							<li>eating in europe in general is so different than in the states (am I becoming that pretentious kid who studied abroad and will only refer to the USA as the states already? *puffs cigarette and sips espresso*), and not just food-wise.  There is absolutely no rush at all to finish your meal.  I feel that back home, whenever I eat out (which was too often), the bill would be handed to you promptly and usually without asking.  In my dining experiences abroad, if you don't ask for the bill, you won't get it.  And it really made for a special experience.  My dinner with Jenny and Liesbeth went on for two and a half hours, and it absolutely flew by.  Though I'm not used to such long meals, there was no pressure to continue conversation.  I love the pace here.</li>
							<li>Driving, however, scares the shit out of me here</li>
							<li>Liesbeth took us on a quick tour by car after dinner on the way back to the apartment, showing us various bars and hotels to visit.  She told me that sometimes, when she can't find parking, she'll pretend to stay at a hotel just so the valet will take her car.  A life pro tip I will definitely try out one day.</li>
