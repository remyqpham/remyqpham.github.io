						<h1>The Research</h1>
						<p>Jenny is an absolute gear FIEND, and I would be lying to you if I said I didn't catch travel gear fever from her.  For a few months prior to my departure, I started reading about long term travel, and learned a few things:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>There is a niche community I read about online dedicated to minimalist travel; in other words, those who want to travel with only the bare essentials.</li>
							<li>A related term, or more specifically, the name of a subset of this community, is one bag travel, where people travel longterm while allotting themselves only one carry-on sized bag with which to do so.</li>
							<li>All of these things are impossible.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>The last point proved to disprove itself over the course of the last few weeks.  Buying into these ideas, I decided to try to minimize my travel techniques and try to become a one bag traveler.  Not having to deal with lugging a huge suitcase around, and having everything I need on my back seemed pretty convenient.</p>
						<h2>The Perfect Travel Bag</h2>
						<p>I'm the type that needs to research and review every aspect of anything before I commit financially; therefore, that entailed reading reviews for days on end, on an endless number of travel packs, until I was set on just one.</p>
						<h2>The Criteria</h2>
						<p>I decided I'd want the following traits in my next big purchase:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Hip Straps - these are necessary for transferring the weight of your bag from your shoulders to your hips.  Literally taking the load off of your shoulders makes for much easier traveling by foot.  I knew this prior to my research, as one of my school bags had hip straps, although minimal ones.  Using them significantly made walking to class easier, as I generally would carry a book or two, along with my laptop.  Lugging the same weight around in a Jansport would kill my shoulders after a while.</li>
							<li>Plenty of padding - no one likes sweaty or uncomfortable walks - padding on the back, shoulder, and hip straps would take care of that.</li>
							<li>Large Relative Size - I wouldn't be making the transition into a minimalist traveler lifestyle easily, so a bit more room would be preferred.</li>
							<li>Pockets for Organization</li>
							<li>Lockability</li>
						</ul>
							
						<h2>The Victor - The Tortuga Travel Bag</h2>
						<p>After months of review, I decided to take the plunge and get the Tortuga V2.  It was tough to decide on a bag without having tried it on, but it seemed to satisfy all of my previously described requirements.</p>
						<h2>Comfortable Despite the Size</h2>
						<p>The Tortuga is a 44L pack, making it a rather high capacity bag compared to some of its competitors.  However, this doesn't make the bag unnecessarily large itself.  It still fits the normal airline's carry-on bag size specifications, as tested personally on Norwegian and easyJet airlines.  But man, can you fit a lot in this pack.  I tested out its capacity before leaving, and could fit loads in it.  However, my new minimalist philosophy prevented myself from taking full advantage of its potential.  I ended up fitting the following contents in my bag:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>5 t shirts</li>
							<li>1 Dress Shirt</li>
							<li>2 shorts</li>
							<li>1 long pant</li>
							<li>Clark Boots</li>
							<li>Xero Shoes</li>
							<li>New Balance Minimus Shoes</li>
							<li>5 pairs of socks</li>
							<li>6 boxers</li>
							<li>Toiletries</li>
							<li>TF300 tablet, dock, and charger</li>
							<li>Macbook and charger</li>
							<li>Phone charger</li>
							<li>External Battery (Thanks Jenny)</li>
							<li>Jansport Backpack (yo I heard you like packs...)</li>
							<li>Resistance Loop</li>
							<li>Folder for Documents</li>
							<li>Notebook and Pens</li>
							<li>Passport</li>
							<li>Belt</li>
							
							
						</ol>
