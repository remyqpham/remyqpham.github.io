						<h1>A Roman Surprise</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I've been lagging on the blogging front so from now on this will serve to be an impossibly poorer form of organized writing. literary hitlers I apologize.</li>
							<li>nimes turned out to be a pleasant surprise; in all honesty, I just picked it on google maps prior to departing the states because it's along the way from marseille to carcassonne.</li>
							<li>nimes greeted us with immediately beautiful and aged views that otherwise can't be replicated. I'm certain my mess of a blog will do it no justice, at least textually, so I hope the following embedded pictures make up for it.</li>
							<li>a preface to the description of my experience at the carée d'art, a modern art museum which we visited in nimes; in my opinion, a work of art's 'success', though it can arguably not be objectively defined, is reliant upon the reactions which it elicits.  for example, if i feel nothing in experiencing a piece of art, graphic, aural, or otherwise, it is, in my mind, 'unsuccessful'. easy listening is bullshit, mainstream art is the easy way out.  if a song or piece of art makes you feel great, happy, then that's success.  yet also, if a piece of art makes you squirm, clench, cringe, flinch, salivate, etc. then it too is successful.  to elicit emotional reaction is success in art.  </li>
							<li>that being said, I was uncomfortable as all hell in the carée d'art museum. there was some really cool, interesting, thought provoking pieces which I always enjoy.  then there's shit like this:</li>

							<li>I mean honestly, holy hell; this is what you see when you walk into the next room.  it was one of those silent things that takes you a second to sink in before you realize okay, something is not correct in the present scheme of things and now I am uncomfortable.  cool stuff though.</li>
