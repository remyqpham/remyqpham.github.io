						<h1>It Gets Better Everyday</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li>woke up, grabbed a quick breakfast in Nice before heading to the train station to head to cannes</li>
							<li>headed to the gare de nice, only to find out we were supposed to go to nice st augustin station.  what started off as a calm morning turned slightly hectic as we raced to make the right train</li>
							<li>we arrived on time, and met our second airbnb host, catherine, who was gracious enough to pick us up from the station.</li>
							<li>she brought us into her lovely home, about 2km inland from the coast of cannes.  we rested for a moment, and she took us on a short, scenic drive and dropped us off near the port.</li>
							<li>we walked around in awe of the abundance of shops, cafes and people.  I ate at a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant, and ordered a kebab wrap with SAMURAI SAUCE BAYBAY!!! it's quickly becoming my favorite quick meal/sawce</li>
							<li>we met a local canadian couple at that restaurant, one of which happened to work at cisco, like me! small world indeed.  I am just now realizing how dumb I must have sounded, asking him simply "oh you work for cisco too?  Do you know sean?  You know, sean."  derp</li>
							<li>foolishness aside, they ended up giving us some great tips for traveling in cannes, and recommended going to the ile ste marguerite, the bigger of a pair of islands just off the coast of cannes.  they mentioned it costs only 12 euros to get there, and that you might as well be in the caribbean when you arrive.  I guess I know what we're doing tomorrow afternoon.</li>
							<li>they also told us about an ongoing weekly international fireworks competition hosted in cannes, with britain showing off their stuff tomorrow night.  anyone on the coast of cannes near the port will have a front row seat.  I guess I know what we're doing tomorrow evening.</li>
							<li>my friend, thibaud, who i met during my last visit to cannes, also made plans with us tomorrow night to some big club dance thing with world famous dj's.  he promised us a good time.  so I guess I know what we're doing tomorrow night.</li>
							<li>I think this trip has made me insensitized to amazing things.  I mean seriously, read those last three bullet points.  holy shit! this is amazing!!</li>
							<li>we continued walking around, and found an Orange.fr retailer, where, after an hour's worth of fussing and practicing my french, I finally got working internet, international sms, mms, and calling on my phone! the workers were very friendly and super helpful</li>
							<li>jenny had almost died of starvation at this point, so we hurried to another cafe where she had a salmon quiche and I had my seventh cup of coffee, my 65th of our trip so far.</li>
							<li>we then made our way back to Catherine's home, not before strolling through the shops a bit more, people watching, and picking up some groceries for dinner. I got simply a baguette, paté, brie cheese, and some fruit.  who am I?</li>

							<li>had an interesting encounter with some french punks on the bus.  they first tried to get onto the bus without paying, and were promptly caught.  one of them then shoved me aside to stand next to his friend, which I let go because hey, sometimes people are rude and it's better not to start anything.  then, that same young gentleman moved to a seat behind jenny's and actually pulled out ten of her hairs.  I didn't notice as I was facing the other way, but when she told me, I immediately turned around and gave him my menacing and tear-inducing mean face for a good ten seconds.  In an accent thicker than my wool socks, he asked "is there a problem?"  I replied "encore?" (again?), and he proceeded to look a bit surprised that I spoke french.  all the french my mom taught me kicked in, and I instinctually told him to "dégage", which I think means something along the lines of "piss off."  He got off at the next stop. Kids these days, amirite?  thanks mom</li>

							<li>we made it back to Catherine's, and decided to stay in for the night to take in the past few days, enjoy dinner in her beautiful home, and blog.  Catherine is easy to talk to, and a great host already. she even brought me pizza.  she's done more than what's necessary and I highly recommend anyone going to cannes to stay with her.</li>

						<h1>A Brief Island Getaway</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li>woke up to a huge breakfast from catherine in her lovely backyard. is this the real life? is it just fantasy?</li>
							<li>as advised yesterday, we decided to go to Ile Ste Marguerite.  Catherine, gracious and considerate as always, offered to give us a ride to the port, where we'd depart. in the heat of the situation (literally), we accepted.</li>
							<li>we stopped by her favorite boulangerie and got some lunch to eat on the island.</li>
							<li>we arrived at the port and purchased our tickets. 12 euros round trip! not bad for a last minute island excursion.</li>
							<li>we spent most of the afternoon on the island, about four or five hours. first, we visited the Maritime Museum, which showcased various exhibits with shipwrecked, historical artifacts, as well as modern art.  it was a great blend of the two.</li>
							<li>afterwards, we walked to the other side of the island, which took no more than 15 minutes. we took a swim, and noted that the guy who recommended the island was right; it really did look like we were on the caribbean islands.  the water was crystal clear.</li>
							<li>after a nice walk back to the port, we returned to the mainland of cannes and grabbed some lunch. i had an american burger with a french twist- it had foie gras on it.  seriously.  flavortown, population me</li>
							<li>after, we visited a few shops and walked around before returning to catherine's at about 7.  there, we met tina, another one of catherine's guests.  she's from germany, but speaks french very well.  having a conversation with tina and catherine in french is really nice; having a language in common and not having that barrier to worry about was almost a surreal experience.  I never get the chance to fully exercise my french back home, so conversations like this one make me excited for the next five months.</li>
							<li>I took a power nap and woke up around 9, when I had a small dinner of simply bread, cheese, jam, and foie gras again.</li>
							<li>then catherine dropped us off at a high view point just west of the port, to view the aforementioned fireworks competition.  it was amazing; as jenny tells me, and as I saw, european fireworks shit all over american fireworks.  july 4th celebrations are nothing compared to what Britain displayed this night.  well played.</li>
							<li>at the end of the show, we met with Thibaud, my friend I met three years ago, and we drank together and caught up before heading towards the Baoli nightclub.  we were out until 3am, and my head is still hurting as I write this.  Thanks for the great time Thibaud.</li>

						<h1>Not My Last Day Here</h1>
						<p>Notes</p>
						<ul>
							<li>life's moving too fast.</li>
							<li>I feel I've seen enough beautiful views, sights, and sounds for a lifetime in the past week.</li>
							<li>I woke up with a blistering headache, from what I don't know...</li>
							<li>took the morning to relax and enjoy yet another feast of a breakfast as laid out by the generous and gracious catherine, our host.  she has been incredibly and overwhelmingly accommodating.</li>
							<li>Liesbeth picked jenny and I up at 13h, and we made our way to a parfumerie at which her friend works in grasse, not before stopping by a boulangerie to pick up some snacks.  I got two quiches :3 </li>
							<li>we attended a workshop where we got to make our own perfume/cologne.  the process was much more interesting than I initially anticipated.  one is to choose a few 'base' scents, round it out with five or six 'heart' scents, and finally finish with 'top' scents, which are the first impression of the scent.  I went with a stronger base and aimed to direct the rest of the scent with the latter categories.  the result? 'Au Bord du Lac,' or The Lakeside. thought of it myself. ;)</li>
							<li>After the brief annhilation of our sense of smell, we made our way to Liesbeth's apartment to hang out.  We stopped by a supermarket and picked up some food, namely brie cheese, some pate, bread, other spreads, etc. </li>
							<li>we ate at Liesbeth's place, which is nothing short of breathtaking.  it was everything I never knew I wanted in a place.  an incredible view, brand new furnishings, nice color scheme, not too expensive.  definitely inspiring; this is not my last day in cannes, so long as I can help it.</li>
							<li>before returning to catherine's for our last night, liesbeth took us to another beautiful viewpoint in antibes.  it was a great way to end our all-too-short stay in cannes.</li>
							<li>onto marseilles!</li>
							<li>to be updated.</li>
