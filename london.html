                            <li>Afternoon tea is a thing, and expensive one, and is a top 2 food experience in my life</li>
                            <li>Did I mention my new friend, Emma Oppong, is one of the most generous people I've ever met?</li>
                            <li>London has taught me to relax and enjoy the food I have and the time I have with friends, instead of scarfing the former down like it's my last meal on earth</li>
                            <li>Checked out Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square, the pronunciation of which I'm still trying to figure out</li>

                        </ul>
                                <p>When Jenny went to Thailand a few years ago, she met Emma Oppong, who is from London.  We planned to meet up on Saturday, where she had our day planned.  First, we went to see Wicked at a theater just across Victoria station.  I've only been to Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera before, both long ago, so seeing a musical was refreshing.  Emma told us theater was a big thing in London, so it was nice to able to start off ourday with a more typical British activity.</p>
                                <p>Days prior, she promised us a trip to afternoon tea.  To be quite honest, I almost regretted the decision of afternoon tea over lunch, as offered by Emma, just because I was so hungry at that point. I didn't think much of it either, other than to expect tea at some small tea shop somewhere.</p>
                                <p>Wrong.</p>
                                <p>So, so, so wrong.</p>
                                <p>We arrived at Savoy around 6pm, where Emma made reservations.  Oh, and I guess it's a five star hotel or something, whatever.  That's a Yelp 5 star review right?</p>
                                <p>Anyways, I'm lucky Jenny recommended earlier in the day to wear my button up dress shirt and the like, as everyone there was dressed to the nines.  Rightfully so; a British afternoon tea is nothing like my preconceived notion of a casual, cheap, tea; rather, it was a full 3 or 4 course meal, with the tea of your choosing.</p>
                                <p>First, I receved my tea, a British Chai.  Jenny ordered a Lychee tea, which was as exotic as it was tasty.</p>
                                <p>Then we received our first course; raisin scones with a variety of spreads, which included a strawberry jam (pretty good), lemon butter (a perfect blend of sourness and sweet), and some sort of cream (HOLY #$%# THIS MUST BE WHAT THE GODS SPREAD ON THEIR BREADS). The scones were buttery and filling, but not overbearingly sweet.  The best scones I've had in my life, by far.</p>
                                <p>On the same multi-layer tray on which the scones and spreads were served, we also received a wide variety of finger sandwiches.  This cute little sammies each not only were made of different fillings, ranging from egg salad, salmon and cream cheese, cucumber, chicken, and more, but each had a different bread as well.  Remember when you were a kid and you'd tear off all the crusts of your sandwiches only to be left with the sweet, soft middle?  It was like that, except you could order endless sandwiches.  It was insane.</p>
                                <p>After the savage waiters at Savoy were done assaulting us with delicious mini sammies, we were tasked with finishing a plate of five small, beautifully intricate desserts.  Why was I doing this?  How did I ever come to deserve this treatment?  I'm a peasant at heart.  What was I doing there?!</p>
                                <p>Anyways, even when the onslaught of desserts was supposedly over, the waiter brought our last course, which was, of course, MORE CAKE.  Really?  Really.</p>
                                <p>Emma graciously offered to cover the bill, which, in addition to her treating us to wicked, I think makes her more generous than anyone I've ever met in my life combined.  Especially considering an afternoon tea like ours is not easy on the bank account by any means.  My right pocket was wet with the tears of my wallet just looking at the menu.</p>
                                <p>I still quite can't over the generosity offered by Emma.  Monetarily, alone, our day and her treatment is something I'd never expect from anyone.  Her treating me, basically a stranger, to such a lovely and unforgettable day, asking for nothing in return, inspires me to try to do the same for her and any others in the future.  But she did more for me and Jenny than just buy us nice things, which to me, was the richest part of her contribution to our experience.  Even after Wicked and our afternoon tea, she spend hours afterwards showing us around various popular attractions in London, including Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street, and numerous other places.  I can hardly think of another time someone was so selfless and gracious with their time towards another visitor.  I am deeply indebted to Emma for this experience.</p>
                                <p>I came away from this first full day in London not only with a full stomach and satisfied tourist desires, but also a hunger to give others experiences like the one I was given.  Not a bad first day.</p>

                                <h1>London, Day 3</h1>
                                <p>We went to Goldsmith's Cafe for the second morning in a row; a full breakfast for 4.50 pounds was a pretty nice deal.  New Cross served to be a pretty quiet town during the day, and limited breakfast options; I think we stumbled upon a good one.  The service there is very nice and considerate; the workers took time to help us out with our order and give us directions to certain attractions, as well as advice for what to do.  And I should mention that the full breakfast is really delicious and filling.  Although, curiously, I ended up preferring the vegetarian "sausage" over the regular British sausage.  The latter had almost a pasty taste, as how I infer British sausages generally taste; the sausage I tried at Sainsbury's on our last morning in London confirmed so.  Still good though, just...pasty.</p>
                                <p>Jenny and I walked to a quiet park just down the street from New Cross Gate station afterwards, and enjoyed taking a minute to relax and watch local life as it exists in New Cross.</p>
                                <p>We then made our way to the Tate Modern museum via train.  Lately I've really been getting into modern art, and the Tate Modern really fed my appetite for it.  There were a multitude of free exhibits, which occupied three or so hours of our time.</p>
                                <p>It was interesting to see that the first thing you step into in the Tate Modern is a huge open concrete space, through which you walk to enter the main exhibits.  It almost seemed that it was a meta-exhibit of sorts; not necessarily the space itself as a work of art, but rather the reactions it solicits from its inhabitants.  At least, that's what I noticed; given such a blank, bleak large space, slightly inclined, it was amazing to see children's minds and bodies running freely through it, as parents and strangers alike observed from the same floor, or from floors above.  Maybe this was the purpose; maybe I'm reading into a concrete room too much.  ART, amirite?</p>
                                <p>I was pleased to see plenty of pieces from the likes of Dali, Matisse, and Picasso as well.  I was never one for visual art before, as my creative spark flows musically, but I still find plenty of inspiration through new and old works alike.</p>
