						<p>In summary, I'll be embarking on a five month study abroad experience in France on August 18th, in Bordeaux, France.  I've left early, today, July 30th, in order to backpack across the southern coast of France, not before an extended pit stop in London.  My itinerary is as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>London, England</li>
							<li>Nice, France</li>
							<li>Cannes, France</li>
							<li>Marseilles, France</li>
							<li>Nimes, France</li>
							<li>Carcassonne, France</li>
							<li>Bordeaux, France</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Over the next few months, I hope to keep you as updated as I can here on my blog.  I can't promise organization or consistency in posts, with regards to content or time, but what I can promise is hopefully a clear glimpse into what I'm lucky enough to experience overseas for the rest of 2015.</p>

						<h1>AirBnB</h1>

						<p>Our preferred method of stay for this trip is an experimental one:  we've chosen to book strictly AirBnB's at every stop we take, with the exception of Nice and Carcassonne;  there, we'll be staying with an old friend and my uncle, respectively.</p>
